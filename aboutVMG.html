            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>Barangay II-C is envisioned to be a progressive community and responsive to the needs of its residents while retaining its caring, warm atmosphere that is perfect for raising families..<br><br>

                The barangay is a “Home”, represented by its official logo depicting a mother and child residing securely within a dwelling, amidst the backdrop of modern progress, yet preserving family and neighborly bonds.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mission">
            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p> In fulfillment of this vision, the Barangay II-C government sees its mission as consisting of three main streams:

                First, the expansion of its public services: a clean and livable community, increasing the access of its residents to jobs and livelihood opportunities, especially entrepreneurship and skills development, a people-oriented and community-based health care system, free and quality elementary to college education, youth development, legal services, socialized housing and urban renewal, safety and security, utilities development, and a strong system of physical infrastructure to facilitate movement and circulation within and to the environs of Barangay II-C to serve the rapidly burgeoning residential and commercial areas of the barangay.
                
                Second, conscious of its importance in the history and culture of Barangay II-C, the “Barangay II-C Historical Corridor” was established to accentuate the nationalism over time of its people and complement beautifully the active annual observance of critical historical events in Barangay II-C.
                
                Third, Barangay II-C being a city, there is also a need to respond to the call of the fast-changing times to upgrade the quality of its public service, developing its human resources, and making its services more fast and efficient down to the barangay level.</p>

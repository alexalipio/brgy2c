                    <p>The Office of the President of the Philippines (OP; Filipino: Tanggapan ng Pangulo ng Pilipinas), is an administrative, advisory, and 
                        consultative government agency that aids the president of the Philippines in performing their duty as head of state and chief of the 
                        executive branch of government.</p>

                </div>
                    <p>The Office of the President (OP) was created through Administrative Order No. 322, s. 1997. The order was issued following the submission 
                        of position papers by the officials of the Department of History of the University of the Philippines, and the Board of National Historical 
                        Institute which conducted deliberations and consultations in four meetings held at the Malacañang Palace from May 5 to June 25, 1997.<br><br>
                        The order established the office retroactively to the date of the date of the Tejeros Convention. The convention was held on March 22, 1897, 
                        which saw the election of Emilio Aguinaldo as President of the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines.<br><br>
                        The OP was abolished after the capture of Aguinaldo in 1901 by the Americans and was reinstated after the proclamation of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935.<br><br>
                        Then-newly elected President Rodrigo Duterte reorganized the OP on June 30, 2016, when he issued his first Executive Order as president.</p>
                        <br><br>
                    <h2>Mandate</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>
                        The Office of the President's mandate is to provide administrative, advisory, consultative and other support services to the President in 
                        the latter's exercise of their powers and functions as Head of State and of the Executive Branch.

                    <h2>Core Function</h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>The executive powers of the President under the 1987 Constitution from which the Office of the President mandate emanates, includes 
                        among others the President's power of control over all the executive departments, bureaus and offices, and the chief executive 
                        departments, bureaus and offices, and the Chief Executive's Constitutional duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed. 
                        Based on said executive powers of the President, the OP proper would perform the following core functions:[7]</p><br>

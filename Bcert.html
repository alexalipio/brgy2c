            <p><b>How To Get A Barangay Certificate Of Indigency Or Low Income?</b><br><br>
               
                To get a Barangay Certificate of Indigency or Low Income, you can follow these steps:<br>

1. Visit your Barangay Hall. This is where you can apply for the certificate.<br>

2. Ask the Barangay Secretary or any designated officer for the application form for an Indigency or Low Income certificate.<br>

3. Fill out the form completely and accurately. Make sure to provide all the necessary information.<br>

4. Prepare any supporting documents that may be required, such as proof of income or any other relevant documents.<br>

5. Submit the filled-out form and supporting documents to the Barangay Secretary or designated officer.<br>

6. Wait for the processing of your application. This may take some time, so be patient.<br>

7. Once your application is approved, you will be issued a Barangay Certificate of Indigency or Low Income.<br>

8. Keep the certificate in a safe place, as you may need it for various purposes, such as availing of government assistance programs or other benefits.<br><br>

                <b>How and where to get the certificate</b>
                <br>
               
                The very first thing you should do is go to the barangay hall where you are a registered voter and request for a Certificate of Indigency or Certificate
                 of Low Income. It's very important that you visit the barangay hall personally because the requirements often differ from one community to another. Ask
                  the person in charge about the documents that you need to process before you can be given a certificate. The requirements needed vary from one barangay 
                  to another but these may include any of the following:<br><br>

                
                1. Barangay Certification / Barangay Certificate of Residency<br>
                2. Certificate of No Property from Municipal Assessor's Office<br>
                3. Certificate of No Business from the Municipal Treasury Office<br>
                4. Certificate of Tax Exemption from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)<br>
                5. Assessment Report from the CSWDO or MSWDO<br>

                <br><br>
               
                In short, aside from visiting your barangay hall for a request, you might also need to go to offices of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) 
                for proper assessment. The steps are often as follows: (1) Register. (2) Submit barangay certification of residency and indigency letter. (3) Receive certificate 
                of indigency.<br><br>

                Here's the mostly used format as well as a sample of a barangay Certificate of Indigency / Certificate of Low Income:<br><br>

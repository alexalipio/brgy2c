            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>General Trias is envisioned to be a progressive city and responsive to the needs of its residents 
                but remain a caring, warm community that is ideal for raising families.<br><br>

                The city is a “Home”, as exemplified by its official logo where a mother and child live safely inside a dwelling, 
                in the middle of “modern progress, while still maintaining family and neighborly ties”.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mission">
            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p> In fulfillment of this vision, the City government sees its mission as consisting of three main streams:<br><br>

                First, the expansion of its public services: a clean and livable community, increasing the access of its residents to jobs 
                and livelihood opportunities, especially entrepreneurship and skills development, a people- oriented and community based-health care system, 
                free and quality elementary to college education, youth development, legal services, socialized housing and urban renewal, safety and security, 
                utilities development and a strong system of physical infrastructure to facilitate movement and circulation within and to the environs of 
                General Trias to serve the rapidly burgeoning residential and commercial areas of the city.<br><br>
           
                Second, conscious of its importance in the history and culture of General Trias, the “General Trias Historical Corridor” was launched February 28, 1997 
                by then  Mayor Luis IV Ferrer, as the centerpiece of its Tourism Master Plan. It accentuates the nationalism over time of General Trias people 
                and complements beautifully the active annual observance of critical historical events in General Trias of the Revolution of 1896.<br><br>
           
                Third, General Trias being a city, there is also a need to respond to the call of the fast changing times to upgrade the 
                quality of its public service, developing its human resources and making its services more fast and efficient down to the barangay level.</p>

                <div><p>Originally named after its Patron Saint, Francis of Assisi, 1181-1226, the municipality of General Trias was founded in December 13, 1748. The original name of the town was changed to General Trias in honor of Gen. Mariano Trias (1869-1914), by virtue of a law fathered by Emilio P. Virata during his term as representative of Cavite, 1919-1921.</p></div>

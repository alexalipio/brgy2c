            <p><b>How To Get A Barangay Certificate Of Indigency Or Low Income?</b><br><br>
               
                A Certificate of Indigency or a Certificate of Low Income is a document that are sometimes required by the Philippine government or a private institution 
                as proof of an individual's financial situation. The certificate is often required to avail of government services (i.e. educational scholarships, 
                medical assistance).<br><br>

                <b>How and where to get the certificate</b>
                <br>
               
                The very first thing you should do is go to the barangay hall where you are a registered voter and request for a Certificate of Indigency or Certificate
                 of Low Income. It's very important that you visit the barangay hall personally because the requirements often differ from one community to another. Ask
                  the person in charge about the documents that you need to process before you can be given a certificate. The requirements needed vary from one barangay 
                  to another but these may include any of the following:<br><br>

                
                1. Barangay Certification / Barangay Certificate of Residency<br>
                2. Certificate of No Property from Municipal Assessor's Office<br>
                3. Certificate of No Business from the Municipal Treasury Office<br>
                4. Certificate of Tax Exemption from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)<br>
                5. Assessment Report from the CSWDO or MSWDO<br>

                <br><br>
               
                In short, aside from visiting your barangay hall for a request, you might also need to go to offices of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) 
                for proper assessment. The steps are often as follows: (1) Register. (2) Submit barangay certification of residency and indigency letter. (3) Receive certificate 
                of indigency.<br><br>

                Here's the mostly used format as well as a sample of a barangay Certificate of Indigency / Certificate of Low Income:<br><br>
